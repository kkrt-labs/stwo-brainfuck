# stwo-brainfuck

`stwo-brainfuck` is a ZK-VM for the Brainfuck language[^1], based on Stwo[^2].

## Objectives

- Capacity of generating and verifying a proof for arbitrary Brainfuck programs.
- Understanding of using Stwo for building ZK-VMs
- Understanding of mordern AIR (RAP) design for (C)STARK-based systems.

## Design choices

### Brainfuck VM

The Brainfuck language has a very loose specification, though,
a [general specification](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Conventions) has been established as a minimal base.
We try to follow these guidelines.

- The memory cells take values in the Mersenne31 (M31) field: $[0..2^{31} - 1)$
- Memory is fixed at 30,000 cells by default, but is configurable.
- Overflow/Underflow works, can be used for memory value `mv`,
but would usually panic for memory pointer `mp` as it is unlikely the memory array will be of size $2^{31} - 1$.
- Inputs are line-buffered (ends with the linefeed ASCII character `10`).
- CLI uses Stdin and Stdout for IO.
- For library use, input can be simulated by any reader (e.g. `Cursor`) and
output with any writer (e.g. a custom writer).
